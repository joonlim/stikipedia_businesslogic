	/**
	 * This API is used to create a connection between a RPC server and a
	 * RabbitMQ message broker using PHP.
	 *
	 * Important:
	 * RabbitMQ must be set up in the producer, consumers, and brokers.
	 * 
	 * Usage: 
	 * 1. Create an instance of RpcServer in the consumer.
	 * The constructor takes file (default: "broker_ip.txt") which should 
	 * contain the message broker's IP on the first line.
	 * 2. Call RpcServer::start(), which takes a binding key an a function to
	 * call when a message is received by the producer. Calling start(), will 
	 * cause this script to run until it is turned off.
	 * 3. The binding key must match the routing key of the producer for the
	 * message to be recognized.
	 * 5. The function should take a string as its only parameter since it will
	 * be handling the producer's message.
